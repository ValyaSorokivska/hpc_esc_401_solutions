Exercise 1
------------

Paths:
1. HOME=/users/vsorokiv
2. SCRATCH=/capstor/scratch/cscs/vsorokiv

My  permissions  of HOME and SCRATCH are:
drwx------ 700 vsorokiv:uzh8 /users/vsorokiv
drwxr-x--- 750 vsorokiv:uzh8 /capstor/scratch/cscs/vsorokiv
So my HOME is private and SCRATCH is  for group.

I cannot access other users' HOME and  I also cannot read exam solutions.
ls: cannot access '/users/meberlei/exam_solutions.txt': Permission denied
drwx------ 2 meberlei uzh8 4096 жов 15 11:28 /users/meberlei

Group_note.txt is -rw-rw---- (660) and the directory allows the group to create/replace files (770).
echo "hello group" > group_note.txt
chgrp uzh8 group_note.txt
chmod 660 group_note.txt         
chmod 770 $SCRATCH               


Default starting permissions for files are 666 (read & write for everyone) and for directories are  777 (read, write & execute for everyone)

With 000 nobody can read/write/execute (not even the owner).  The data is not lost, as owner I restored access with chmod 600 and read the file.
echo "secret" > locked.txt
chmod 000 locked.txt
ls -l locked.txt  # ---------- (000)
chmod 600 locked.txt
cat locked.txt    # "secret"


Exercise 2
-----------
1.1. end with 00
command: grep -E '^[01]*00$' binary.tx
examples of regular expressions:0000000000000000, 0000000000001100, 0000000000010100

1.2. start and  end with 1
command:grep -E '^1([01]*1)?$' binary.txt
examples of regular expressions:  1000001111110011, 1011111111110001

1.3. contain the pattern 110
command:  grep -E '110' binary.txt
examples of regular expressions:0000000000000110, 0000000000001100, 0000000000001110

1.4. contain at least three times a 1
command:grep -E  '^[01]*1[01]*1[01]*1[01]*$' binary.txt
examples of regular expressions: 0000000000000111, 0000000000001110, 0000000000001111

1.5. contain at least  three consecutive 1s
command: grep -E '^[01]*111[01]*$' binary.txt
examples of regular expressions: 0000000000000111, 0000000000001110, 0000000000001111

2 In a directoty measured there is  a file out.txt where ie all temperatures from  measured/measurements*.txt. The avarage temperature is 20.576 degrees.


Exercise 3
----------
factor 20 ---- 20: 2 2 5
factor 31 ---- 31: 31

Using factor and wc keeps the script short and robust. Input checks prevent crashes.

For big numbers with time function:
1. 4230283 is prime. Elapsed: 0.007 s
2. 4572862171001 is prime. Elapsed: 0.007 s
